I&rsquo;d much rather keep it simple and concise.</p><p>This website is mainly a landing page for my domain, which I use to host various applications and to have somewhere to direct people when they ask for my details, almost like a digital business card. I might occasionally write some blog posts if I feel there&rsquo;s something I can add to the conversation, although I&rsquo;m not much of a blogger.</p></main><footer><small>Copyright © 2025, Ned Faulkner | Made with <a href=https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub>Bear Cub</a></small></footer></body></html>
