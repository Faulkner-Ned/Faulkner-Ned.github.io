## Who am I
My name is Ned Faulkner. I've been a professional software engineer for over 5 years. I'm based in Reading, UK, but would love the opportunity to travel. I'm currently specialised in Cloud/"Cloud-native" applications & Kubernetes but I also have experience rapid-prototyping and developing React web apps.

I feel most comfortable when working with Python, Go, Bash or Infrastructure as Code but I have experience with React.js (TypeScript) and Java (Spring). I have worked on both public and private sector projects at various scales, ranging from small internal applications to high-availability, highly sensitive systems handling millions of records. I try to help out and make the odd contribution where I can within the Open-Source Cloud-Native ecosphere.

## About this site
I'm not really one to have a super flashy website. I'd much rather keep it simple and concise.

This website is mainly a landing page for my domain, which I use to host various applications and to have somewhere to direct people when they ask for my details, almost like a digital business card. I might occasionally write some blog posts if I feel there's something I can add to the conversation, although I'm not much of a blogger.
